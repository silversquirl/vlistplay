# vListPlay

vListPlay is a music player with playlist support, written in HTML and
JavaScript. It uses the fast, lightweight Vue.js framework to handle
events and data binding, and loads the track list from a JSON file using
AJAX.

vListPlay is designed as a Vue component, making it easy to embed into
any webpage, especially those already using Vue.
